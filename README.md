Hi Janet,



 



I wanted to talk about this but as you are not well, will
email and we can talk about this once you are better. But let me know via email
about your interest on this. Both Aravind and I think you are at a good point
and a candidate with Freddie experience to take on this. However we both also
know that you had intensions to also maybe roll off this project and work on things
with Meera/Sneha. So wanted to talk about this and see if you are willing to
take this opportunity.



 



So there is an opportunity to take on couple of duties and roles/responsibility
from me that I do in this project. Things like processing the requests and
assigning them to our team members, overseeing delivery of reports and
assisting in any escalations with the work we do. The overseeing the work delivery
and working with various teams is the important part and challenging which I think
you are capable of taking over. This might also include reporting to Brian and
communicating with him eventually.



 



I am looking at you to take this additional duties along
with your current assessment work which of course can be toned down to working
on only selected factory scans and critical urgent requests. 



 



My management is looking at me to reduce my time and work
here to 50% so I can help the south east region. Hence Aravind and I are seeing
if you want to take on these duties. Let me know and of course we can talk once
you are back form PTO or once you are well.



 



Thanks,



Smith
